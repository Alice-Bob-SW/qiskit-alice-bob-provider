    """Create a Qiskit Target from a ProcessorDescription

    A ProcessorDescription is the description of the properties of a quantum
    processor. In this regard, a processor has the same function as a Qiskit
    Target.

    Please note that the Qiskit target produced by this function does not fully
    represent the array of operations available on the processor.

    This is because, contrary to what is advertised in the Target documentation
    at https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.transpiler.Target.html,
    the Qiskit transpiler expects the names of instructions in a Target to be
    listed under their Qiskit operation names. Otherwise they won't be taken
    into account and used by some transpilation passes who have a basis_gates
    argument like UnrollCustomDefinitions.

    This is not a problem for scheduling because durations are obtained from
    the richer ProcessorInstructionDurations class which derives from
    InstructionDurations.
    This might be an issue for other types of transpilation passes.

    Here's a concrete example of this loss of information:

    If an Alice & Bob processor implements the following instructions:
    * p0, which translates to Initialize(0)
    * p+, which translates to Initialize (+)
    * rz, which translates to RzGate(Parameter('angle'))
    * rzpio2, which translates to RzGate(np.pi/2)

    Then the corresponding Qiskit Target will contain the following
    instructions:
    * 'initialize' --> Initialize(0)
    * 'rz' --> RzGate(Parameter('angle'))

    This loss of information cannot be avoided because Qiskit identifies
    instructions by their names for simplicity.

    The last instruction (rzpio2) is a made-up example for the sake of clarity.

      actually different from the basis gates supported by the backend: not
      all backend basis gates can be used as basis gates for the SK synthesis.
      Unfortunately, Qiskit does not allow setting a different basis gate
      set for the synthesis step, so we hack our way around it.
    * Compute approximations for the SK synthesis using only the 1-qubit gates
      of the SK basis gate set
    * Mix the SK synthesis with the transpilation passes from
      StatePreparationPlugin

    This plugin wouldn't exist if Qiskit's transpile exposed more options to
    configure the synthesis method (and didn't override the available options
    in strange ways)."""
